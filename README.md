# echo

A location based social network with a unique two dimensional interface in place of a convential timeline. Built with React and Apollo.

## developing

Make sure you have this stuff installed before digging in:

- [Node v10+](https://volta.sh/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

If you're all set, do the following in two separate tabs:

### tab 1

```
docker-compose up
```

### tab 2

Once docker-compose is up and running...

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn dev
```

Assuming all goes well, echo will be accessible from http://localhost:4200.
